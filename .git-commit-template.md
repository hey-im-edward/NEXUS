# Git Commit Summary

## Major Refactor: Simplify Architecture for MVP

### Summary
Removed NestJS backend and Docker setup, migrated to Supabase-only architecture. This simplifies development for a 2-person team with zero backend experience while maintaining all core functionality through managed services.

### Changes

#### Removed
- `backend/` - NestJS application (replaced with Supabase)
- `database/` - Database initialization scripts (now in docs)
- `docker-compose.yml` - Container orchestration (using cloud services)
- Root `package-lock.json` - Unused monorepo file

#### Added

**Documentation (20+ files):**
- Complete 12-week roadmap with weekly checklists
- User research templates (interview script, personas, metrics)
- Architecture decision records (ADR)
- Database schema with Row Level Security (RLS)
- AI prompts guide for development
- Setup and quick start guides
- Weekly focus tracker

**Code Structure:**
- Supabase client configurations (browser + server)
- TypeScript types for database and app models
- Utility functions
- Environment variable templates

**Configuration:**
- VS Code extensions recommendations
- Updated package.json with Supabase dependencies

#### Modified
- Updated README.md with complete project overview
- Restructured frontend folder with proper organization
- Moved chat logs to `docs/archive/`

### Rationale

**Why remove backend?**
1. Team: 2 people, part-time (20h/week)
2. Budget: $0/month (free tier requirement)
3. Timeline: 12 weeks to MVP
4. Skill: Zero backend experience, AI-assisted development

**Why Supabase?**
- Managed auth, database, storage, real-time
- Free tier: 500MB DB, 50K MAU
- No DevOps, instant deployment
- Open-source (can self-host later if needed)

### Tech Stack (Final)
```
Frontend: Next.js 14 + React 19 + TypeScript
Backend: Supabase (Auth + PostgreSQL + Storage)
State: Zustand
UI: TailwindCSS 4 + shadcn/ui
Deploy: Vercel + Supabase Cloud
Cost: $0/month for first 500-1000 users
```

### Migration Path
If Supabase becomes a bottleneck:
1. Self-host Supabase (open-source)
2. Migrate to NestJS API (4-6 weeks effort)
3. Keep Supabase Auth (decoupled)

Trigger: >5K active users OR complex backend logic needed

### Next Steps
1. Complete 10 user interviews (Week 0-3)
2. Setup Supabase project (30 min)
3. Build POC (Week 4-7)
4. Ship MVP (Week 8-11)

### Files Ready for Development
- [x] Database schema with RLS policies
- [x] TypeScript types
- [x] Supabase client configs
- [x] Environment templates
- [x] Complete documentation
- [x] Weekly roadmap and checklists

**Status:** ✅ Ready to start Week 0 - User Research

**Suggested commit message:**

```
refactor: Simplify architecture - Remove NestJS backend, adopt Supabase

BREAKING CHANGE: Removed entire backend/ folder and Docker setup.

- Remove: NestJS backend, Docker Compose, database configs
- Add: Supabase integration (auth, database, storage)
- Add: 20+ documentation files (roadmap, research, architecture)
- Update: Frontend structure with proper organization
- Update: package.json with Supabase dependencies

Rationale: Simplify for 2-person part-time team with $0 budget.
Supabase provides managed backend services on generous free tier.

Cost reduction: $30-80/month → $0/month
Setup time: 2-3 weeks → 30 minutes
Maintenance: DevOps required → Zero maintenance

Tech stack finalized:
- Frontend: Next.js 14 + React 19 + TypeScript
- Backend: Supabase (managed)
- Deploy: Vercel + Supabase Cloud
- Free tier: Supports 500-1000 users

Ready for: Week 0 - User Research phase
```
